# Workspace Cleanup Summary

## Changes Made

### 1. **File Organization**
- ✅ Moved all test files (`test-*.js`) to `tests/` directory
- ✅ Created `tests/README.md` to document the test files
- ✅ Moved API documentation from `API Docs/` to `docs/api/`
- ✅ Removed empty `API Docs/` directory

### 2. **Removed Duplicate/Unnecessary Files**
- ✅ Removed `setup-codesigning.md` (duplicate of `CERTIFICATE-SETUP.md`)
- ✅ Removed empty `REVIEW-CHANGES.md` file
- ✅ Removed `codesign-cert.p12` from repository (sensitive file)

### 3. **Code Structure Improvements**
- ✅ Refactored `src/index.ts` by extracting tool definitions to separate files
- ✅ Created `src/tools/definitions.ts` for tool schema definitions
- ✅ Created `src/tools/handlers.ts` for tool execution logic
- ✅ Created `src/tools/index.ts` for clean exports
- ✅ Backed up original `index.ts` as `index-old.ts`

### 4. **Enhanced .gitignore**
- ✅ Added better coverage for sensitive files (`.env.*`, `*.key`)
- ✅ Added commented option to exclude tests directory if needed
- ✅ Improved organization with better comments

### 5. **Dependencies**
- ✅ Verified all dependencies are necessary and in use
- ✅ No unused dependencies found

### 6. **Build Verification**
- ✅ Tested TypeScript compilation - successful
- ✅ All refactored code compiles without errors

```

## Benefits for Major Upgrade

1. **Modular Architecture**: Tool definitions are now separate, making it easy to add new tools
2. **Clean Separation**: Business logic is separated from infrastructure code
3. **Better Organization**: Documentation and tests are properly organized
4. **Secure**: Sensitive files are properly excluded from version control
5. **Maintainable**: Code is more readable and easier to extend

## Notes

- Original `index.ts` is preserved as `index-old.ts` for reference
- All functionality remains the same, just better organized
- Ready for adding new AvaTax API calls with minimal effort
- Test files are preserved but organized for better structure

## Next Steps for Major Upgrade

With this clean foundation, you can now:
1. Add new tool definitions to `src/tools/definitions.ts`
2. Add corresponding handlers to `src/tools/handlers.ts`
3. Extend the AvaTax client with new API methods
4. Maintain clean separation of concerns
