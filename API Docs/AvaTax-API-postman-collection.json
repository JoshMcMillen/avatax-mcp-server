                 "description":  "Welcome to the AvaTax API Postman Collection! \n                \nThis collection provides a REST interface to Avalara\u0027s enterprise tax service, AvaTax. You can use this collection to interact with the AvaTax APIs while building your integration. \n\nWhile using this collection, we recommend following along with our Developer Implementation Guide: https://developer.avalara.com/avatax/dev-guide/   \n\nAPI requests are grouped into folders to help you navigate through the collection easily. Each request includes a description of the operation and its associated URL, method, headers, and example request body (if applicable). \n\nThe collection uses Postman environment variables for the API base URL and credentials, making it easy to switch between the sandbox and production environments.\n\nTo get started, ensure you have the necessary credentials. Then, update the \u0027username\u0027 and \u0027password\u0027 variables in the \u0027Authorization\u0027 or \u0027Variables\u0027 section with your credentials if you prefer username and password authentication. Alternatively, you can use the \u0027account_id\u0027 and \u0027license_key\u0027 variables for authentication using an account ID and license key.\n\nWe recommend starting with the Ping API, located within the Utilities folder, to test your connectivity and ensure your authentication credentials are valid. The Ping API is a simple way to check if you can successfully communicate with AvaTax.\n\nCollection Variables:\n- Base URL: The base URL for the API. By default, it is set to the sandbox URL - https://sandbox-rest.avatax.com. \n    - Change this variable to switch between sandbox and production environments:\n        - Sandbox URL: https://sandbox-rest.avatax.com\n\t\t- Production URL: https://rest.avatax.com\n- Username: If you are using username and password authentication, enter your username for AvaTax.\n- Password: If you are using username and password authentication, enter your password for AvaTax.\n- Account ID: If you are using account ID and license key authentication, enter your AvaTax account ID. \n    - Be sure to also replace the username variable in the authorization tab with account_id.\n- License Key: If you are using account ID and license key authentication, enter your AvaTax license key.\n    - Be sure to also replace the password variable in the authorization tab with license_key.\n\nHappy testing with AvaTax APIs!",

To build a tax content\r\nfile for a multiple locations in a single file, please use `BuildTaxContentFile`.\r\n            \r\nNOTE: This API does not work for Tennessee tax holiday scenarios.\n\n### Security Policies\n\n* This API requires one of the following user roles: AccountAdmin, AccountOperator, AccountUser, BatchServiceAdmin, CompanyAdmin, CompanyUser, Compliance Root User, ComplianceAdmin, ComplianceUser, CSPAdmin, CSPTester, ECMAccountUser, ECMCompanyUser, FirmAdmin, FirmUser, ProStoresOperator, Registrar, SiteAdmin, SSTAdmin, SystemAdmin, TechnicalSupportAdmin, TechnicalSupportUser, TreasuryAdmin, TreasuryUser.\n* This API depends on the following active services:*Required* (all):  AvaTaxPro.\n"

The end result will be the total tax calculated by AvaTax based on your\r\ncompany\u0027s configuration and the data provided in this API call.\r\n            \r\nThe `CreateTransaction` API will report an error if a committed transaction already exists with the same `code`.  To\r\navoid this error, use the `CreateOrAdjustTransaction` API - it will create the transaction if it does not exist, or\r\nupdate it if it does exist.\r\n            \r\nTo generate a refund for a transaction, use the `RefundTransaction` API.\r\n            \r\nAn address is required for calculation. If no address is provided at the line level, the document level address will be used.\r\n\r\nThe field `type` identifies the kind of transaction - for example, a sale, purchase, or refund.  If you do not specify\r\na `type` value, you will receive an estimate of type `SalesOrder`, which will not be recorded.\r\n            \r\nThe origin and destination locations for a transaction must be identified by either address or geocode.  For address-based transactions, please\r\nprovide addresses in the fields `line`, `city`, `region`, `country` and `postalCode`.  For geocode-based transactions, please provide the geocode\r\ninformation in the fields `latitude` and `longitude`.  If either `latitude` or `longitude` or both are null, the transaction will be calculated\r\nusing the best available address location information.\r\n            \r\nYou may specify one or more of the following values in the `$include` parameter to fetch additional nested data, using commas to separate multiple values:\r\n            \r\n* Lines\r\n* Details (implies lines)\r\n* AccountPayableSalesTaxDetails (implies lines - only for Account Payable transaction)\r\n* Summary (implies details)\r\n* Addresses\r\n* SummaryOnly (omit lines and details - reduces API response size)\r\n* LinesOnly (omit details - reduces API response size)\r\n* ForceTimeout - Simulates a timeout.  This adds a 30 second delay and error to your API call.  This can be used to test your code to ensure it can respond correctly in the case of a dropped connection.\r\n* TaxDetailsByTaxType - Includes the aggregated tax, exempt tax, taxable and non-taxable for each tax type returned in the transaction summary.\r\n            \r\nIf you omit the `$include` parameter, the API will assume you want `Summary,Addresses`.\r\n            \r\nNOTE: Avoid using the following strings in your transaction codes as they are encoding strings and will be interpreted differently:\r\n* \\_-ava2f-\\_\r\n* \\_-ava2b-\\_\r\n* \\_-ava3f-\\_\n\n### Security Policies\n\n* This API requires one of the following user roles: AccountAdmin, AccountOperator, AccountUser, BatchServiceAdmin, CompanyAdmin, CompanyUser, CSPTester, SSTAdmin, TechnicalSupportAdmin, TechnicalSupportUser.\n* This API depends on the following active services:*Required* (all):  AvaTaxPro, BasicReturns.\n"
