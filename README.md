## 🛠️ Development Setup

For developers who want to build and modify the AvaTax MCP Server:

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 16+ 
- Windows (for code signing)
- AvaTax Developer Account

### First-Time Setup
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and configure your AvaTax credentials
4. Run the setup script: `.\scripts\setup.ps1 -SetupCertificate`
5. Build the project: `npm run smart-build`

### Certificate Configuration (One-Time)
The setup script will:
- Install required PowerShell modules
- Securely store your code signing certificate password
- Enable automatic builds without manual password entry

```powershell
# Set up certificate password (run once)
.\scripts\setup.ps1 -SetupCertificate

# Check setup status
.\scripts\setup.ps1 -ShowStatus

# Remove stored password if needed
.\scripts\setup.ps1 -RemoveCertificate
```

### Building Releases
After initial setup, building is fully automated:

```powershell
# Interactive build with version selection
npm run smart-build

# Quick version bumps
npm run release:patch   # 1.0.4 → 1.0.5
npm run release:minor   # 1.0.4 → 1.1.0
npm run release:major   # 1.0.4 → 2.0.0
```

The build system will:
- Automatically handle certificate password from secure storage
- Build TypeScript and Electron application
- Create signed Windows installer
- Optionally create GitHub release

## Build Instructions
